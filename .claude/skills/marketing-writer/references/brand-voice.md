# Brand Voice Guidelines

## Core Principles

**Casual and direct** - Write like you're talking to a friend, not pitching to investors.

**No corporate buzzwords** - Avoid: "leverage", "synergy", "ecosystem", "next-gen", "revolutionary", "game-changing", "cutting-edge", "innovative", "disruptive"

**Real benefits, not hype** - Show what it actually does, not what it could theoretically maybe do.

**Simple language** - If a 10th grader wouldn't understand it, rewrite it.

## Voice Examples

### Bad (Corporate/Cringe)
"Our innovative platform leverages cutting-edge AI to revolutionize the way you manage your workflow, providing seamless integration with your existing ecosystem."

### Good (Carlos's Voice)

---

### Bad (Overcomplicating)
"Utilize our sophisticated dashboard interface to gain actionable insights into your operational metrics."

### Good (Clear and Direct)
"See what's happening in your business. All the numbers that matter, in one place."

---

### Bad (Marketing Fluff)
"Experience the future of productivity with our groundbreaking solution that transforms how teams collaborate."

### Good (Real Benefit)
"Your team can finally stop losing track of what everyone's working on."

## Content Templates

### Problem → Solution → Benefit Format

**Problem:** What sucks right now  
**Solution:** What this feature does  
**Benefit:** What changes for the user  

Example:
- **Problem:** You're manually checking inventory levels across 5 different spreadsheets
- **Solution:** PANTRYiQ pulls it all into one dashboard
- **Benefit:** You know what's low before customers ask

### Feature Descriptions

Bad: "Advanced notification system with customizable parameters"  
Good: "Get a text when you're running low on something"

Bad: "Intelligent automation workflows"  
Good: "It orders more stuff automatically when you need it"

## Tone Checklist

Before shipping any marketing content, verify:
- [ ] Could I say this to a friend without sounding like a robot?
- [ ] Does it explain what actually happens, not what theoretically could happen?
- [ ] Would someone who doesn't work in tech understand this?
- [ ] Did I remove all buzzwords and corporate speak?
- [ ] Does it focus on what changes for the user, not how smart the tech is?
