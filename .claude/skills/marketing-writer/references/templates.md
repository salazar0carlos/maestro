## Landing Page Feature Sections

Use the Problem → Solution → Benefit format for each feature section.

### Template Structure

## [Feature Name]

[2-3 sentence problem statement - what sucks about the current way]

[1-2 sentence solution - what this feature does]

[1-2 sentence benefit - what changes for the user, the real outcome]
```

### Example: Inventory Tracking Feature
```
## Stop Losing Track of Inventory

Right now you're probably juggling spreadsheets, manually counting stock, and hoping you remember to order more before you run out. It's a pain, and it costs you money when you either run out or over-order.

PANTRYiQ automatically tracks everything. Every sale updates your inventory in real-time, and you get alerts before you run low.

You'll always know what you have, what's selling, and what to order. No more guessing, no more surprise stockouts.
```

### Example: Automated Ordering
```
## Never Run Out Again

You've probably had that moment - a customer asks for something, you think you have it, but you're actually out. Or you manually create purchase orders every week, which is boring and easy to forget.

Set it once, forget it forever. PANTRYiQ automatically creates purchase orders when you hit your reorder point.

One less thing to remember. Your shelves stay full, your customers stay happy, and you save 2-3 hours a week on ordering.

## Tweet Threads

Structure: Hook → Build Credibility → Show Value → CTA

### Template Structure
```
Tweet 1 (Hook): Bold claim or relatable problem that stops scrolling
Tweet 2-3 (Build): Why you know this / your experience
Tweet 4-5 (Value): Specific thing that solves it
Tweet 6 (CTA): What to do next (low friction)
```

### Example: Launching a New Feature
```
1/ Most retail owners waste 5+ hours a week on inventory. I spent 3 years building liquid handling systems and saw the same mess everywhere.

2/ You're either using spreadsheets (slow, error-prone) or paying $500/month for enterprise software that does way more than you need.

3/ There's a third option: automated tracking that just works.

4/ We built PANTRYiQ for exactly this. It tracks inventory automatically, alerts you before you run out, and integrates with what you already use.

5/ Real example: A shop owner went from 6 hours/week manually updating spreadsheets to checking a dashboard once a day. That's it.

6/ If you're tired of the spreadsheet dance, try it free: [link]
```

### Example: Shipping an Update
```
1/ Shipped a new feature today that I wish existed 5 years ago when I was running my own operations.

2/ The problem: You know something's running low, but by the time you remember to order, it's too late. Happens to everyone.

3/ The fix: Smart reorder alerts. PANTRYiQ now predicts when you'll run out based on your actual usage patterns and warns you with enough time to restock.

4/ Not some vague "you're low" notification. It tells you "order this by Friday or you'll run out next Wednesday."

5/ One beta customer caught 3 potential stockouts last week that they would've missed. That's money saved.

6/ Rolling out to everyone today. If you're using PANTRYiQ, it's already live in your dashboard.

### Example: Feature Launch Email
```
Subject: You can finally stop manually tracking inventory

Hey Sarah,

I know you're probably using a spreadsheet right now to track what you have in stock. I did that for years - it's tedious, easy to mess up, and you're always one forgotten update away from running out of something.

We just launched automated inventory tracking in PANTRYiQ. Every sale updates your stock levels automatically, you get alerts before you run low, and you can see everything in one dashboard. No more spreadsheet hunting.

For your shop specifically, this probably saves you 3-4 hours every week. Time you can spend on literally anything else.

Log in and check it out: [link]

Let me know if you have questions.

### Example: Product Launch Email
```
Subject: Built something for retail owners who hate spreadsheets

Hey Alex,

If you've ever spent an hour updating inventory counts in a spreadsheet and thought "there has to be a better way," this is for you.

PANTRYiQ is a simple dashboard that automatically tracks your inventory, alerts you before you run out, and creates purchase orders for you. It integrates with your POS and suppliers, so you set it up once and it just works.

I built this because I spent years watching businesses lose money on stockouts and manual tracking. This fixes that.
